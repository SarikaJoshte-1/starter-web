Git provides the git config tool, which allows you to set configuration variables. 
Git stores all global configurations in .gitconfig file, which is located in your home directory. 
To set these configuration values as global, add the --global option, and if you omit --global option, 
then your configurations are specific for the current Git repository.

You can also set up system wide configuration. Git stores these values in the /etc/gitconfig file, 
which contains the configuration for every user and repository on the system. 
To set these values, you must have the root rights and use the --system option.


In this chapter, we will discuss the life cycle of Git. In later chapters, we will cover the Git commands for each operation.

General workflow is as follows âˆ’

You clone the Git repository as a working copy.

You modify the working copy by adding/editing files.

If necessary, you also update the working copy by taking other developer's changes.

You review the changes before commit.

You commit changes. If everything is fine, then you push the changes to the repository.

After committing, if you realize something is wrong, then you correct the last commit and push the changes to the repository.

Shown below is the pictorial representation of the work-flow.
