Step 1. Clone your repository to your local system
Open a browser and a terminal window from your desktop. After opening the terminal window, do the following:

Navigate to your home (~) directory.

 
$ cd ~
As you use Bitbucket more, you will probably work in multiple repositories. For that reason, it's a good idea to create a directory to contain all those repositories.

Create a directory to contain your repositories.

 
$ mkdir repos
From the terminal, update the directory you want to work in to your new repos directory.

 
$ cd ~/repos
From Bitbucket, go to your BitbucketStationLocations repository.

Click the + icon in the global sidebar and select Clone this repository.

Bitbucket displays a pop-up clone dialog. By default, the clone dialog sets the protocol to HTTPS or SSH, depending on your settings. For the purposes of this tutorial, don't change your default protocol.
